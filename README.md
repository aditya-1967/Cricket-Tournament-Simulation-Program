# Cricket-Tournament-Simulation-Program
This is an advanced cricket tournament simulation program implemented in Python. The program simulates a cricket match between two teams with detailed ball-by-ball outcomes, player statistics, and field conditions. It provides commentary for each ball and over and keeps track of scores, wickets, and overs


## Methodology
The program is built using object-oriented programming concepts in Python. It consists of the following classes:

* Player: Represents a player with various stats such as bowling ability, batting ability, fielding ability, running ability, and experience.
* Teams: Represents a team with players, a captain, batting order, and current players on the field.
* Field: Represents the field conditions with factors like size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage.
* Umpire: Handles the simulation of ball outcomes based on player abilities and field conditions.
* Commentator: Provides commentary for each ball and over based on the match stats.
* Match: Simulates an individual cricket match with innings, team selection, ball outcomes, and match results.
